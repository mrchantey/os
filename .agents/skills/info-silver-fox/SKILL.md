# silver-fox: Dell Precision 7560

Rebuilt from a fresh Omarchy install on **2026-09-10**, replacing a Dell XPS 15
9500 of the same name that died of a motherboard power fault. The hostname is
unchanged deliberately: `stow/hypr-silver-fox` and `just init-silver-fox` both
key off it.

**Everything below was measured on the machine, not read off a spec sheet.**

## Hardware

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Model | Dell Precision 7560, SKU 0A69, rev A01 |
| BIOS | 1.48.0 (2026-05-31) |
| CPU | i7-11850H, 8c/16t, Tiger Lake-H |
| RAM | 64GB (62GiB usable) |
| dGPU | NVIDIA RTX A2000 Mobile, GA107GLM `10de:25b8`, 4GB GDDR6 |
| iGPU | Intel TigerLake-H UHD `8086:9a60` |
| Panel | BOE 0x08CF on eDP-1, **1920x1080**, 340x190mm, ~143 DPI, 16:9 |
| Audio | Realtek **ALC289** on HDA Intel PCH (card 0), driven by `snd_hda_intel` |
| Microphone | Logitech **Brio 100** over USB (added 2026-09-11); the chassis has **none that works**, see below |
| Camera | the same Brio 100; the chassis has **none**, no `/dev/video*` without it |
| Pointing | touchpad only, **no pointing stick** |

The panel is the FHD SKU. Its only modes are 1920x1080@60 and @48, so there is no
4K here, and no 16:10. That single fact invalidates most XPS-era display config.

### The two GPUs drive different ports

From `/sys/class/drm`:

- **NVIDIA (card1)**: `HDMI-A-1`, `DP-1`, `DP-2`, `DP-3`: the physical HDMI and mDP ports
- **Intel (card2)**: `eDP-1`, `DP-4`, `DP-5`: the internal panel and the USB-C DP-alt ports

This is a genuine departure from the XPS, whose dGPU drove no displays at all.
Plugging into HDMI or mDP wakes the dGPU and keeps it awake, which costs battery
and defeats the on-battery dGPU-suspend behaviour that voxtype and the TTS server
both key off. **Prefer USB-C for a projector when on battery.**

The compositor runs on the Intel iGPU. The NVIDIA card is for CUDA and per-app
PRIME offload:

```bash
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia <app>
```

Never force `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia`. Quattro's `default/hypr/nvidia.lua`
detects the hybrid setup and sets the render env itself, so there is no
`envs-device.lua` and there should not be one.

## Disks

Two NVMes are fitted. **The running system is on the SMALLER, HIGHER-numbered
one**, which is exactly the trap to watch for:

| Node | Device | Size | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nvme1n1` | SK hynix BC711, serial `CY12N087910403351` | 238.5G | **live system**, LUKS + btrfs |
| `nvme0n1` | KIOXIA KXG60ZNV1T02, serial `X93ZZ00TK84L` | 953.9G | transplanted from the XPS, still LUKS, **untouched** |

The KIOXIA is slated to be wiped and reused as blank storage. That has not been
started. Node numbering is not stable across boots, so see `old-drive.md` for the
identification table and the wipe procedure, and read it before touching either
disk.

## Per-device config, and why

`stow/hypr-silver-fox/` holds three modules, stowed by `just stow-device silver-fox`.

**`monitors.lua`** pins eDP-1 to `1920x1080@60` at **`scale = 1`**, with
`GDK_SCALE=1`. Omarchy's `scale = "auto"` picks **1.5** on this panel, which
leaves a 1280x720 logical desktop; scale 1 gives 1920x1080 logical, near-identical
to the effective 1920x1200 the XPS's 4K panel gave at scale 2. It is a 1080p
panel, so there is no HiDPI to serve and no fractional-scaling blur to accept.
Bump to 1.25 if text is too small; do not go back to `"auto"`.

Also holds the fallback auto-mirror rule (`output = ""`), which catches whatever
an external cable enumerates as.

**`input-device.lua`** sets touchpad `natural_scroll` and `clickfinger_behavior`.
Note the two libinput nodes, `dell0a69:00-0488:120a-touchpad` and
`...-mouse`: same HID device, one physical touchpad. The `-mouse` node is not a
trackpoint and needs no configuration.

**`layout-device.lua`** sets the master layout, `new_status = "master"`. New windows fill
the screen. On one 1080p panel there is no room to give away, which is why this
differs from rainbow-cat's centered column.

### Deleted with the XPS

`scripts/silver-fox/present-mirror` and `mirror-watch.sh` forced both displays to
1080p on hotplug. They existed solely because the XPS's 16:10 panel was squished
~11% when mirrored to a 16:9 projector. This panel is natively 16:9 1080p, so the
plain mirror rule already produces a 1:1 image. Nothing was key-bound to them.

### `scripts/silver-fox/install.sh` is currently a no-op

Both of its root-level fixes are inert on this hardware, and both are kept anyway:

- **Keyboard backlight timeout.** No `dell::kbd_backlight` LED exists.
  `dell_laptop` *is* loaded, so this is not a missing module. The 7560's
  backlight is EC-owned. Change the timeout in the BIOS under
  System Configuration > Keyboard Backlight.
- **S3 deep sleep.** `/sys/power/mem_sleep` reads `[s2idle]` with no `deep`.
  Kept because suspend/resume is **untested** here and the fix is one BIOS
  setting away. If this machine starts hard-resetting on resume, look for
  Power Management > Sleep Mode in the BIOS, then re-run the script.

### There is no working internal microphone

Tested on 2026-09-10 and worth knowing before debugging dictation for an hour. The machine exposes a capture source and it is not muted, but it hears nothing. Dictation works through the Brio 100 instead, next section.

What is there: PipeWire lists `alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo`, the
ALC289 declares an internal mic pin (`0xb7a60130`, Fixed / Mic at Oth Mobile-In),
`Internal Mic` capture is `[on]`, `Capture` is `[on]`, the `platform::micmute`
LED reads 0, and nothing is muted in `wpctl`.

What it does: nothing. Recording a 4s clip yields a noise floor and no signal.
The noise floor scales with gain, so there is a live analog input being
amplified, but playing a 1 kHz tone through the speakers (confirmed at -24.7 dB
on the sink monitor, i.e. genuinely audible) produced **no change whatsoever** in
the recorded level (-56.8 dB quiet vs -56.5 dB during the tone). That is an
unconnected ADC input picking up electrical noise, not a microphone.

This matches the missing camera. On this chassis the array mics live in the
camera module in the lid, and there is no camera: no `/dev/video*` exists. So
this is a camera-less SKU, and the BIOS ships the same generic codec verb table
regardless, which is why the pin is still declared.

Ruled out along the way: it is not a DMIC/SOF path. The SOF modules load, but
card0 is `PCH` under `snd_hda_intel` with a single `ALC289 Analog` capture PCM
and no DMIC devices, so the codec's analog input is the only capture path there
is.

**Consequence: voxtype dictation cannot work on the internal hardware**, even though the service installs, enables and runs. A headset on the 3.5mm combo jack would also work, since `Headset Mic` is a separate, currently-`[off]` input on the same codec, but the Brio 100 is what is actually in use.

### Logitech Brio 100: the camera and the dictation mic

Plugged in 2026-09-11, USB `046d:094c`, on `usb-0000:00:14.0-11`. Plain UVC plus USB audio class, so nothing to install. It enumerates as ALSA card `B100` (card 2), PipeWire node `alsa_input.usb-046d_Brio_100_<serial>.mono-fallback` ("Brio 100 Mono", 16-bit mono), and `/dev/video0` + `/dev/video1`, which PipeWire also exposes as a V4L2 source. WirePlumber makes it the default source on its own (`priority.session` 2100 beats the internal codec), so voxtype's `device = "default"` needs no change.

**Its mic powers on at maximum gain and clips.** The one mixer control, `Mic Capture Volume`, runs 0..6144 raw for +6dB..+30dB and ships at 6144. Measured at +30dB, the empty room alone is -22 to -27dBFS RMS with peaks near -9dBFS, so there is no headroom left for a voice. `scripts/silver-fox/startup.sh` sets it to **wpctl 0.4** through WirePlumber, which resolves the node by name via `pw-dump` + `jq` (wpctl only takes IDs) and polls in the background so a login without the camera does not stall startup. WirePlumber then persists the value per device in `~/.local/state/wireplumber/default-routes`, so it also survives replug; the startup line is the reassert and the written record.

The mapping, verified against the mixer: total gain = 30 + 60·log10(vol) dB. 0.7 = +21dB, 0.5 = +12dB, **0.4 = +6dB, the hardware floor**. Below 0.4 WirePlumber pins the hardware at +6dB and attenuates in software, which scales the noise floor down with the voice and improves nothing, so 0.4 is the lowest value worth setting. It is a 24dB cut from power-on, picked from the ambient measurement and then confirmed clean with real voxtype dictation the same day. To re-check after a change of room, distance or unit:

```bash
# talk normally for the 8 seconds, then read the peak. Aim for max around -12 to -6dBFS;
# -0.0 means clipping (lower vol), below -25 means room to go up. -ss 0.5 skips the
# stream-open pop: the first ~100ms of every capture is a -11dBFS transient even in silence.
id="$(pw-dump | jq -r '.[] | select(.info.props["node.name"] // "" | test("^alsa_input\\.usb-046d_Brio_100_")) | .id')"
pw-record --target "$id" --rate 16000 --channels 1 --format s16 /tmp/mic.wav & sleep 8; kill -INT $!
ffmpeg -ss 0.5 -i /tmp/mic.wav -af volumedetect -f null - 2>&1 | grep -E '(mean|max)_volume'
```

If it needs adjusting, change the `0.4` in `startup.sh` and apply it live with `wpctl set-volume "$id" <vol>`; each 0.1 step above 0.4 is worth roughly 5 to 6dB.

### The old mic gain line in startup.sh is gone

Until 2026-09-11 `scripts/silver-fox/startup.sh` set `wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SOURCE@ 0.13`, the XPS-era calibration for the internal Realtek (Capture +6.75dB, boost off). It was correct for that codec and pointless here, because nothing is behind it. With the Brio plugged in it became actively wrong: the Brio is now the default source, and 0.13 on its curve is -23dB total, 29dB below its own hardware floor, all of it software attenuation. The line was replaced by the name-targeted Brio one above rather than kept alongside it. If a 3.5mm headset ever becomes the mic, it is a separate WirePlumber route (`analog-input-headset-mic`) with its own persisted volume, so the old 0.13 would not have carried over to it anyway.

## State as of 2026-09-10

Omarchy `4.0.3-1` (`omarchy-version`), kernel `7.2.3-arch1-3`.

**Working:** all stow packages linked; mise runtimes (node, deno, zig, python) and
the wrangler/cf/claude-agent-acp wrappers; Everforest theme with the Firewatch
wallpaper; Never-Lost-Rainbow cursor; transcribe and tts helpers on PATH; Kokoro
TTS built, enabled and **running on CUDA** (the NVIDIA driver, `nvidia-open-dkms`
610.57.04, came with the fresh Omarchy install); `just pull-repos` clones cleanly
including private repos.

**Root half done** via `just init-silver-fox-sudo`: ghostty, google-chrome,
visual-studio-code-bin, voxtype-bin, rustup + cargo-binstall, cuda, steam,
element-desktop, thunderbird, helix, podman are all installed, and
`voxtype.service` is enabled and active, listening through the Brio 100 since 2026-09-11 (the internal codec has nothing behind it, see the microphone section).

That recipe now runs under `scripts/sudo-keepalive.sh`. The first attempt died
halfway through at `install-rust` with `sudo: timed out reading password`,
because a bare `sudo -v` only holds for five minutes and the install takes about
an hour. The wrapper refreshes the timestamp every 50 seconds for the life of the
run, so it asks once at the start and never again. `just init`,
`just init-silver-fox` and `just init-rainbow-cat` are wrapped the same way.

## Traps

- **Do not trust pre-2026-09-10 silver-fox notes.** They describe the XPS: 4K
  16:10 panel, GTX 1650 Ti, i7-10750H, a dGPU that drove no displays. That
  machine's record was deliberately deleted in commit `3a0a0ec`; do not restore
  it, and do not carry its facts forward.
- **`hyprctl devices` shows two mice for one touchpad.** Not a trackpoint.
- **The internal capture source is not a microphone.** Don't take the presence of `alsa_input...analog-stereo`, an unmuted `Internal Mic` control, or a running `voxtype.service` as evidence that dictation can work without the Brio 100 plugged in.
- **The Brio 100 mic clips at its power-on gain.** If dictation goes to garbage after a fresh install or a wiped `~/.local/state/wireplumber`, check `wpctl get-volume` on the Brio source reads 0.40, not 1.00.
- **Long installs need `scripts/sudo-keepalive.sh`.** A bare `sudo -v` lapses
  after five minutes and the run dies mid-way once nobody is at the keyboard.
- **The old drive is `nvme0n1`, the live one is `nvme1n1`.** Lower number is the
  one to destroy. Match on serial every time, never on node.
