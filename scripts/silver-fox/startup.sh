# NOTE: mirror-watch.sh used to be launched here, to force both displays to 1080p
# when a projector was plugged in. That existed only to stop the XPS's 16:10 4K
# panel being squished onto a 16:9 projector. The Precision panel is natively
# 16:9 1080p, so the plain mirror rule in monitors.lua is already 1:1 and both
# scripts were deleted.
#
# the Logitech Brio 100 is the dictation mic here: the chassis has no working mic
# (camera-less SKU, see the info-silver-fox skill), so voxtype hears through the
# webcam. It powers on at full-scale capture gain (wpctl 1.0 = hardware +30dB), and at
# that level the empty room alone sits at -25dBFS RMS, so speech clips hard and wrecks
# voxtype accuracy. amixer can't fix this: WirePlumber owns the gain and re-applies its
# saved value when it initializes the card, clobbering any amixer call that races ahead
# of it. Set the gain THROUGH WirePlumber instead -- it persists per device
# (~/.local/state/wireplumber/default-routes) and restores it on every boot AND replug.
# The gain is cubic: total dB = 30 + 60*log10(vol), reaching the +6dB hardware floor at
# 0.40; below that WirePlumber adds software attenuation, which scales the noise floor
# down with the voice and buys nothing. 0.4 is the mic's minimum analog gain, a 24dB
# cut from power-on (measured 2026-09-11; re-tune procedure in the info-silver-fox skill).
#
# Targeted by node NAME, not @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SOURCE@. The old line set the default source
# to 0.13, the internal Realtek calibration carried over from the XPS, and with the Brio
# now the default source that would have landed it 29dB below its own hardware floor.
# The Realtek line is gone: there is no mic behind that codec on this machine. wpctl
# only takes IDs, so the name is resolved through pw-dump. The serial is left out of the
# match so a replacement unit is covered too. Backgrounded so a login without the camera
# plugged in (10s of polling) does not hold up the rest of startup.
